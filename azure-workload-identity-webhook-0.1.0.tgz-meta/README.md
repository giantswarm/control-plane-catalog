# azure-workload-identity-webhook

Giant Swarm offers an azure-workload-identity-webhook app which is installed in management clusters by default.

Here, we define the azure-workload-identity-webhook chart with its templates and default configuration.

## Installation

This app is already installed in your management cluster by default and therefore not meant to be installed manually.
